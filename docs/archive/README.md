# Archived Documentation

This folder contains historical documentation that was relevant during earlier phases of development but has since been superseded or is no longer current.

## What's Here

### Event-Specific Documentation
These docs were created for a specific demo/event:
- `DEMO_GUIDE.md`
- `DEMO_CHEAT_SHEET.md`
- `DEMO_FEEDBACK_FORM.md`
- `PRE_DEMO_CHECKLIST.md`

### Implementation Documentation
These docs described how specific features were implemented. The features are now built, but the implementation may have evolved:
- `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `ADMIN_INTERNSHIPS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `ADMIN_STUDENTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `ASSIGNMENT_SYSTEM_REFACTOR.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- `ROLE_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md`

## Why Archive?

These docs were moved to archive because:
1. They describe completed work that may have since been refactored
2. They're event-specific and that event has passed
3. They may contain outdated information from before the project pivot

## Should You Read These?

**Probably not** - unless you're specifically interested in:
- How certain features were originally implemented
- The demo that happened with Dennis
- Historical context on project evolution

**Instead, read:**
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` - Current project status
- `docs/DATA_MODEL.md` - Current data structures
- Current implementation docs for features being built now

## Keeping or Deleting?

We're keeping these archived docs because:
- They show the evolution of the project
- They might be useful for understanding why certain decisions were made
- Portfolio value - showing documentation practices

If the project ever needs a major cleanup, these could be deleted without losing current functionality documentation.
