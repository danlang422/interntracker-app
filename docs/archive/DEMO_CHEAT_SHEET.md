## Questions to Ask Dennis

1. **"Does this core workflow make sense for your needs?"**
2. **"What's confusing or missing?"**
3. **"When would City View need this ready?"**
4. **"Who else needs to sign off on this?"**
5. **"What would be a deal-breaker?"**

---

## Likely Questions from Dennis

**"When can this be ready?"**
→ *"January for testing, February for pilot, March-April for refinements. Does that work?"*

**"What about [feature]?"**
→ *"Great idea! Is that critical for launch or nice-to-have? Let me write it down."*

**"How much time can you commit?"**
→ *"10-15 hours/week. This is my learning project and portfolio piece - win-win."*

**"What if students fake location?"**
→ *"Mentors verify they were actually there. We can also add distance thresholds."*

**"What about privacy?"**
→ *"Only mentors/advisors see exact locations. Students control what's public."*

**"What if internet goes down?"**
→ *"Could add offline mode in Phase 2 - cache locally, sync when reconnected."*

## If Something Breaks
*"That's a known bug - this is prototype stage! Let me show you what should happen..."*

**Don't panic - bugs are expected in demos!**
