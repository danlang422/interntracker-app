# Questions for Dennis and Blenda

## Attendance System Questions

### Check-In Timing & Windows
1. **Check-in windows:** How long after a block starts should students be able to check in before it's considered problematic?
   - Example: If Block 1 starts at 8:00am, can students check in until 8:15? 8:30? Anytime during the block?

2. **Notification timing:** How long after a student hasn't checked in should staff be notified?
   - 5 minutes? 15 minutes? Start of next block?

3. **Late check-ins:** Can students check in retroactively (like checking in for Block 1 during Block 2)?
   - If yes, should this trigger different workflows or notifications?

### Attendance Statuses
4. **Required statuses:** Beyond Present/Absent/Tardy/Excused, are there other attendance statuses you need?
   - Examples from SIS systems: "Activity", "Field Trip", "Office", "Nurse", etc.

5. **Tardiness thresholds:** Do different types of blocks have different rules for what counts as "tardy" vs "present"?
   - Example: Kirkwood classes might have stricter timing than Monitor periods

### Staff Workflow
6. **Preemptive attendance:** Should teachers be able to mark students present BEFORE they check in?
   - Some teachers may prefer to just "take attendance" traditionally rather than relying on student check-ins

7. **Bulk attendance marking:** What tools does the secretary need for handling common scenarios?
   - Example: Student calls in sick - mark excused for all blocks that day
   - Example: Early dismissal for appointment - mark excused for afternoon blocks

### Remote Work Check-Ins
8. **Progress note check-ins:** For students working remotely, they check in with progress notes 4x/day. Do these need staff review/approval, or are they just informational?

9. **Remote vs. block check-ins:** Are the 4 daily progress check-ins INSTEAD of block-by-block check-ins, or IN ADDITION to them?
   - Our current thinking: Use regular block check-ins (keeps it consistent for IC reporting) but remote students add progress notes to each one

## Schedule Management Questions

### Schedule Structure
10. **Block timing flexibility:** Do all students follow the same 5-block structure, or can individual students have different block times based on their Kirkwood schedule?
    - Example: City View Block 1 is 8:00-9:30, but student's Kirkwood class is 9:00-10:00

11. **Infinite Campus requirements:** Does IC need attendance per specific block, or just present/absent for the day?
    - This affects whether we need to strictly align with IC's block structure

12. **Schedule changes:** How often do student schedules change?
    - Weekly? By semester? Ad-hoc when students switch classes?

### Special Schedules
13. **Early dismissal/late start:** How should the system handle non-standard schedule days?
    - Our idea: Admin can toggle between "Regular Day", "Early Dismissal", "Late Start" schedules
    - Would you want to set this in advance or day-of?

14. **Schedule building:** Who inputs student schedules into the system?
    - Students self-report? Staff imports from Kirkwood/IC? Both?

## Internship Check-In Questions

15. **Internship check-in frequency:** For students at internships, should they just clock in/out for the day, or also do the 4x progress check-ins?

16. **Geolocation accuracy:** How strict should location verification be?
    - Within 100 meters? 500 meters? Just verify they're not at home/school?

17. **Internship attendance:** Does internship clock-in count as attendance for specific blocks, or is it separate?

## General System Questions

18. **Audit trail requirements:** What level of change tracking do you need for compliance?
    - Who changed what, when, and why?
    - How long should this history be kept?

19. **Reporting needs:** What attendance reports do you need to generate?
    - Daily? Weekly? By student? By block?

20. **Mobile vs. desktop:** Will students primarily check in from phones or computers?
    - This affects UI design priorities

## XQ Competencies Questions

21. **Grade level filtering:** Are certain XQ Competencies only assessed for certain grades?
    - Should 9th graders only see certain competencies when tagging work?

22. **Assessment vs. tagging:** In V1, are students just self-tagging reflections with competencies, or should they also self-assess their progression level?

23. **Multiple frameworks:** Will City View only use XQ Competencies, or might you want to add other standards/frameworks too?

## Feature Priority Questions

24. **V1 must-haves:** If you had to pick the THREE most critical features for next semester, what would they be?
    - Our current thinking:
      1. Attendance check-in system
      2. Schedule management
      3. Internship clock-in/out
    - Does that match your priorities?

25. **Nice-to-haves for V1:** What features would be valuable but not blocking launch?
    - Reflections system?
    - Photo uploads?
    - Competency tagging?
    - Public feed/social features?

## Notes
- These questions emerged from discussing how to build an attendance system that handles City View's unique structure (mixed Kirkwood/City View/internship/remote schedules)
- We want to make sure we're building the right thing before diving into implementation
- Some questions may reveal features we haven't even considered yet!
