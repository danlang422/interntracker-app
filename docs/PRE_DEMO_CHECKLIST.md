## During Demo - Remember

✅ **Breathe** - Pause between sections  
✅ **Ask questions** - "Does this make sense?"  
✅ **Write everything down** - All feedback matters  
✅ **Stay positive** - Even for critical feedback  
✅ **Be honest** - If you don't know, say so  
✅ **End with energy** - Thank Dennis genuinely

## If Things Go Wrong

### If app crashes or breaks:
1. Stay calm: "That's a known bug - prototype stage!"
2. Use backup tab or restart server
3. Or just describe what should happen and move on
4. Make note to fix it later

### If Dennis asks something you can't answer:
1. "That's a great question - let me write that down"
2. "I'll need to research that and get back to you"
3. "Help me understand more about why that's important"

### If you forget what to show:
1. Glance at cheat sheet (it's okay!)
2. Ask Dennis: "What would you like to see?"
3. Or: "Let me show you one more quick thing..."
